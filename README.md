I am an intermediate beginner on programming and I am currently working on improving my programming skills on R. This repository will mainly contain all the various Exercises from different sources eg. W3Resources R questions, etc. 
This activity will mainly help me build my portfolio and grow my skills.

I will use programming questions from Introduction to programming using Python only that I will program these exercises with R.
I will divide the work into chapters starting with:
  1. Introduction to R
  2. Elementary programming
